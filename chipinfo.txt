Exynos 5422 big.little
cat /proc/cpuinfo for core info
per forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?t=2580:
	CPU part = 0xc07 => LITTLE (A7)
	CPU part = 0xc0f => big (A15)

cat /dev/bL_status for big.little status, whichever has L2 set to 1 is live cluster

allegedly, using ondemand governer (/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor = ondemand) and /dev/b.L_operator = 01 should lock the device in LITTLE only mode
allegedly, using performance governer (scaling_governor = performance) is big only
This is not the case on Kernel 4.9

at least as soon as kernel 4.9 this is a lot simpler.
can now set /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu{$n}/online to 0/1 to disable/enable individual cores
check status with /sys/devices/system/cpu/online. results like "0-7" or "1-2,4-7"
per the "CPU Part" littles are 0-3, bigs are 4-7

monitor thermals with /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
